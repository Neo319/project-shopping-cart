## Description

This is a personal portfolio project built as a monorepo. It is a solution to the ["Shopping Cart" project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum. This project aims to create a user-friendly eCommerce storefront, with a stateful shopping cart that tracks a user's items.

It is primarily intended to practice using React, and specifically its useState and useEffect Hooks, to manage stateful interactions in a front-end application. This project also makes use of API calls to [fakestoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) for its store inventory.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Netlify.

[See Live Preview here.](https://lighthearted-licorice-112eb9.netlify.app)

## Usage

This eCommerce storefront features a user-friendly interface, an integrated state to manage a user's cart, and calls to fakeStoreAPI to display a store inventory.

Users can navigate to the app's Shop page, select various items of specified quantities and add them to their cart. From there, they can navigate to the cart page, and see the total price of their selected items.

Core purpose:

- State management of a user's cart.
- manage making API calls to a remote backend.
- User-friendly interface elements and react client-side routing.
